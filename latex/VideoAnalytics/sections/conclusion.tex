\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed an adaptive contextual task assignment framework for edge-assisted crowdsourcing systems in vehicular networks, with a focus on energy-aware and reward-optimized scheduling of video analytics tasks. By modeling worker-task pairs via context vectors and employing an online contextual bandit approach with dynamic partition refinement, our method is capable of learning high-reward allocations under uncertainty.

We developed a simulation environment to evaluate the proposed algorithm and conducted comparative experiments against baseline strategies. The results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher cumulative net reward and lower per-step regret compared to the random baseline, and approaches the performance of an oracle strategy with full knowledge of true rewards.

Although our experiments are based on synthetic data and simplified assumptions, the promising results suggest the effectiveness of adaptive context modeling in dynamic edge environments. In future work, we plan to incorporate more realistic datasets, heterogeneous mobility models, and dynamic worker availability, and extend our method to support multi-task replication under energy and latency constraints.
